# contest-snippets
Vim snippets for competitive programming.


## Installation

It is recommended to use [Vundle][vundle] to install this plugin (it's cleaner this way). You will also need [UltiSnips][ultisnips] to use these snippets. In your `.vimrc`:

    Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'         "required
    Plugin 'hav4ik/contest-snippets'  "that's all :)

Additionally, you might want to install [vim-snippets][vimsnips] for other useful snippets. I personally don't use it.
